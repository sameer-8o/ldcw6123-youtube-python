LDCW6123 - Part 2: Interactive Program (Python)
Topic: YouTube as a Disruptive Innovation (Clayton Christensen's model)
Program: YouTube Video Recommendation Assistant

Note: The assignment brief lists C++ as the default language for Part 2,
but the lecturer confirmed Python is allowed for this group.

------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW THIS FILE IS ORGANIZED (read top to bottom):
  1. Video data model      -> what one "video" looks like
  2. Video catalog         -> the list of sample videos
  3. Small helper functions-> reused for input, printing
  4. Feature functions     -> one function per menu option
  5. Menu + main loop      -> ties everything together

# ============================================================
# SECTION 1: Data model
# ============================================================
# A "Video" holds everything the program needs to know about one
# video: its title, category, mood, length, popularity, channel,
# and a short description shown to the user.

@dataclass
class Video:
    title: str
    category: str    # e.g. Tech, Music, Fitness, Education, Comedy, Gaming, Vlog
    mood: str         # e.g. Relaxing, Exciting, Informative, Funny
    duration: int      # length in minutes
    views: int         # popularity, in millions (used only for sorting/display)
    channel: str
    description: str


# ============================================================
# SECTION 2: Video catalog (sample data)
# ============================================================
# This acts as a small "database" of videos. To add a new video,
# copy one line's pattern and adjust the values. Categories and
# moods should match one of the options shown in the menus below.
